# WIP

This is a repository for a Reed College thesis template using [quarto](https://www.quarto.org). Not currently usable (i.e. not compliant with specification), but we plan to get there!

## Roadmap

### v1
Fully compliant with [official specificaion](https://libguides.reed.edu/thesis/formatting)

This is the "make it work no matter what" stage: even if we need to copy/paste the entire RMarkdown template and then shove Quarto in there, we'll get it to work.

### v2
Alter with official feedback, general code cleanup

Run this template by the librarians, see if there's anything beyond the official specification that we need to include. Also clean up the code a bit and start to move away from the "whatever works" mentality.

### v3
Visual updates

Change any formatting, fonts, etc. into something that looks nice; in other words, turn this template from "someting you techincally could use" into "something you might want to use."

### 1.0.0
Good template!

Finally, do some more maintenance and clean up the user interface for using this template. Here we want to minimize the technical knowledge necessary to use this for a normal case (so it's not just a personal project).

### future?

If all of that goes well, maybe we can try to get official support (or at least recognition) for this template. One step at a time though!

## Code of Conduct
Don't be a meanie!

Seriously though, this is currently a small personal project â€” if it ever becomes an official template then we'll revisit this more seriously, but for now I retain full power in deciding what's okay and what's not. Be a respectful person and you'll be fine.

That being said, any and all contributions are welcome! Make an Issue or Pull Request and I'm happy to review it.
