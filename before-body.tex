% Oddities:
%
%   We *ASSUME* that any time \cleardoublepage is called
%  we actually want a blank back side with NO page number/heading
%
%   Minor bug -- seems to be a more general LaTeX thing:
%  If you use \frontmatter \mainmatter without any chapters inbetween
%  be prepared to have the page numbering messed up. Not a big deal,
%  but I'm not sure how to fix it.
