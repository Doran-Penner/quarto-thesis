% TODO better citation?

% This file is based on the official thesis specification and code by Sam Noble.
% I'm uncertain if what I've done counts as enough to be considered my own work or
% a derivative of Sam's, so for the sake of giving credit and legal safety
% I will include the full original comment here, with my name added to it.

% Acknowledgements Page, David Perkinson & Sam Noble
% May 2005 Patrick Carlisle Table of contents chapter definition
% 2004-2005 Ben Salzberg (BTS) a variety of tweaks here and in the template
% 2024 Doran Aviv Penner: heavy modification for new template
%
% Oddities:
%
%   We *ASSUME* that any time \cleardoublepage is called
%  we actually want a blank back side with NO page number/heading
%
%   Minor bug -- seems to be a more general LaTeX thing:
%  If you use \frontmatter \mainmatter without any chapters inbetween
%  be prepared to have the page numbering messed up. Not a big deal,
%  but I'm not sure how to fix it.
