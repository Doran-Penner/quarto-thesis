miscellaneous notes on what to work on, things to keep in mind, etc.

Current required sections (key: **required**, ~~done~~):
- ~~**Title Page**~~
- ~~**Approval Page**~~
- Acknowledgments / Preface
- List of Abbreviations
- ~~**Table of Contents**~~
- ~~List of Tables/Figures/Spectra~~
- **Abstract**
- Dedication
- ~~**Major body of text**~~
- Glossary
- Appendix
- Endnotes
- ~~**Bibliography / References**~~
- Index

are the default margins correct?

page numbering (when exactly we start it) might be awkward

I want to add more "pages" before the main section... is that feasible?
And if not, how *should* we do acknowledgements, etc?
