miscellaneous notes on what to work on, things to keep in mind, etc.

to avoid too much painful abstraction, we should expect users to use `_quarto.yml`
- besides the `.qmd` files, what else should we plan on being part of a "normal" experience?

We can put things in folders! So maybe all the "main" content goes in there.
Can't put the index in a folder...
but maybe could do some wacky `include` stuff to *technically*
have a top-level index but not really.

is it okay to have page numbering (roman) on title page?
