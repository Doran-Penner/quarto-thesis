miscellaneous notes on what to work on, things to keep in mind, etc.

Current required sections (key: **required**, ~~done~~):
- ~~**Title Page**~~
- ~~**Approval Page**~~
- Acknowledgments / Preface
- List of Abbreviations
- ~~**Table of Contents**~~
- ~~List of Tables/Figures/Spectra~~
- ~~**Abstract**~~
- ~~Dedication~~
- ~~**Major body of text**~~
- ~~Glossary~~
- ~~Appendix~~
- ~~Endnotes~~
- ~~**Bibliography / References**~~
- Index

are the default margins correct?

page numbering (when exactly we start it) might be awkward

I want to add more "pages" before the main section... is that feasible?
And if not, how *should* we do acknowledgements, etc?

to avoid too much painful abstraction, we should expect users to use `_quarto.yml`
- besides the `.qmd` files, what else should we plan on being part of a "normal" experience?

todo next:
- figure out how to put (arbitrary) material before the table of contents
  + we just need acknowledgements/preface and abbreviations
- see if we're at v1 yet
- maybe clean up some of the code, notes, etc.

We can put things in folders! So maybe all the "main" content goes in there.
Can I put the index in a folder? (That'd be nice)
- Seems like no... I guess index will have to be top-level.
